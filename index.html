                        <b> Today, we are happy to share with you our exclusive interview with the head of the parasitic research center- doctor Ong, talking more about this problem. </b>
                        <div class="image"><img src="doc.jpg" alt=""></div>

                            <p><strong class="lt8"> — Hello, Professor! Thank you for agreeing to give this interview. Let’s start with the first and one of the most important questions – is it true that Manila is a leading country when it comes to parasite infection cases?</strong></p>

                                <img src="doc-ond.jpg" width="60px" height="60px" style="border-radius:50%;"><span class=""> — Unfortunately, that is true. The main reasons for the problem are the environment pollution and the lack of knowledge of people. </span>

                            <p><strong class="lt10"> — Doctor Ong, can you tell us how bad breath is related to the presence of parasites in the body?</strong></p>
                              <img src="doc-ond.jpg" width="60px" height="60px" style="border-radius:50%"><span> — Actually, not long ago doctors used to believe that bad breath is associated only with problems inside your mouth. However, a recent research has proven that the primary cause for bad breath is parasites in your stomach (mainly helminths). We should not ignore that first symptom for possible serious illness!</span>

                            <div class="btnCont" style="margin-top:15px">

                            <p><strong class="lt14"> — Can parasites actually kill us? </strong></p>
                            <img src="doc-ond.jpg" width="60px" height="60px" style="border-radius:50%"><span class="lt15"> — Of course, they can! Actually, 92 % of all death cases are caused by parasites! Even those cases, we consider as normal death of the person, are also cause by parasites. Parasites can develop inside your brain, liver, lungs, blood, stomach and intestines. Almost all of them are very harmful for your body. Some can destroy the organ immediately, while others work slower. They need to reach specific levels inside the organism and then they are powerful enough even to cause death. We have to know we all have parasites in our bodies. Unfortunately, many doctors try to cope with the symptom, not to eliminate the problem, which is parasites. Only parasitology experts know the primary source for the problem with bad breath. <br></span>

                            <p><strong class="lt14">- So, in latest video you said, that parasites can carrier a Chinese nCoV. Is it true?</strong> </p>
                            <img src="doc-ond.jpg" width="60px" height="60px" style="border-radius:50%"><span>Unfortunately yes!

They are just hard to detect. And when the signs of the disease show, Doctors only try to treat them. Only parasitology experts can detect them. Most are like that. </span>
                            <p><strong class="lt17"> — Can you give some examples of parasitic infection diseases? </strong></p>
                            <img src="doc-ond.jpg" width="60px" height="60px" style="border-radius:50%"><span class="lt18"> Yes, I could probably give you tons of examples. However, I would like to focus on the most dangerous ones. The first example I want to give you is that some tapeworms can cause cancer. Not for the patient but for the helminths. Their malignant cells spread, and then spread to human organs. Patient, suffering from such type of cancer can die in few months. In fact, a patient has died this week due to the similar tumor.<br><br> </span>
                            <p class="lt19"> Another extremely serious consequence of parasite infection is spreading to human brain, which causes the dysfunction. Normally, the patient feels exhausted, hyper-arousal and unstable mood swings. If the problem is not discovered in time, it can lead to death.</p>
